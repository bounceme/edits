Preinstall:

Install `csswatcher':

  sudo cpan i CSS::Watcher

Note:

Please, keep CSS::Watcher up-to-date.
Recommended version of csswatcher is 0.4.0 (run `csswatcher -v'). Update:

  sudo cpan i CSS::Watcher

Configuration, Emacs:

  (require 'ac-html-csswatcher)
  (ac-html-csswatcher-setup)

Configuration, project:

File ".csswatcher" may indicate root of your project and used for set ignored files:

  % cat .csswatcher
  # ignore all css
  ignore: \.css$
  # except app.css
  use: app\.css

Otherwise projectile way used for root directory.

So if you use `ac-html-bootstrap' and don't want to parse your bootstrap.css
create in your project file .csswatcher with line:

  ignore: bootstrap

Note: completion will regenerated by csswatcher after saving css, less,
opening html files, or manually by `ac-html-csswatcher-refresh'.
